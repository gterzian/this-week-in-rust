Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

# Updates from Rust Community

## News & Blog Posts

* [Programming Servo: Zen and the art of removing blocks from your system](https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/programming-servo-zen-and-the-art-of-removing-blocks-from-your-system-51c1b7d404e3)

# Crate of the Week

This week we have two crates: [memory-profiles](https://github.com/nokia/memory-profiler), does what it says on the box. [momo](https://github.com/llogiq/momo) is a procedural macro that outlines generic conversions to reduce monomorphized code. Thanks to [ehsanmok](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/549) and llogiq for the suggestion!

# Quote of the Week

> Just the presence of well integrated Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) makes an incredible amount of difference. They are used to represent errors in a meaningful and easy to understand way (`Result<T>`), are used to show that a function may or may not return a meaningful value without needing a garbage value (`Option<T>`), and the optional case can even be used to wrap a null pointer scenario in a safe way (Option<Ref<T>> being the closest to a literal translation I think).
>
> Thatâ€™s just one small feature that permeates the language. Whatever the opposite of a death-of-a-thousand-cuts is, Rust has it.
